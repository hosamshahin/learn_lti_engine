<h4>oauth_nonce</h4>

    <p><code>oauth_nonce</code> is a random string generated by the learning
    platform. It's used to add randomness to the launch signature (I'll talk
    about that in a minute) to improve security.</p>
    <p>LTI docs say that your app should keep a history of used nonces and
    not allow reuse of the same nonce for multiple launches within a reasonable
    window of time (say, 90 minutes).</p>
