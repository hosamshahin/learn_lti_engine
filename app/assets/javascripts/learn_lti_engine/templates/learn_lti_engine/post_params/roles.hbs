<h4>roles</h4>

<p><code>roles</code> is another important parameter for you to check. It'll
    tell you how a person is tied to the course or group, which should help you
    determine permissions and access for the user. For example, you may want to
    let teachers have edit privileges but not students..</p>
    <p>There are a number of different role types available, and users can
    have more than one role type attached, they'll come across as a comma-separated
    list in this single parameter. There are also some shortcut values meant
    to make it easier on everyone, but you should probably check for both
    the shortcuts and longer versions in case someone doesn't support them.
    </p>
    <p>Also, there are <a href='http://www.imsglobal.org/lti/blti/bltiv1p0/ltiBLTIimgv1p0.html#_Toc261271984'>
    a lot of role types available</a> but since their mapping isn't well-defined,
    the best I can do is point you to the obvious ones, and tell you how
    Canvas handles these roles.
    Possibilities listed below:</p>

          <td>Nobody</td>
          <td style='font-size: 10px;'>This user has no association with the course/group. Think of
          this as an unauthenticated user who launched your app from
          a publicly-visible page.

          <td>Admin</td>
          <td style='font-size: 10px;'>This is an account manager with permission over the course. I typically
          map this role to the same permissions as an instructor.

          <td style='font-size: 10px;'>This is a TA for the course. <b>Note: Canvas sends TAs across with the <code>Instructor</code>
          role, not the <code>TeachingAssistant</code> role</b> since it
          wasn't clear how well the TA role was supported by third parties.
          </td>
          <td><code>TeachingAssistant</code> or <code>urn:lti:role:ims/lis/TeachingAssistant</code>.

          <td style='font-size: 10px;'>This is someone associated with the course who is not a teacher
          or student. In Canvas this could be an auditor, a parent, a counselor,
          or any other person with the observer role in Canvas.

    <p>This time rather than pasting in the value you get, you'll need to 
    parse it out and select the matching roles for the currently-launched
    user. I'm going to make you do it three times to make sure you've 
    got it down. Enjoy :-).</p>
